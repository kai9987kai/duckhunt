### USER CONFIGURABLE SETTINGS ###
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Protection Policy Options:
#   "paranoid"  - Lock keyboard input until the correct password is entered.
#   "normal"    - Temporarily disable keyboard input when an attack is detected.
#   "sneaky"    - Drop selected keystrokes to disrupt potential attacks.
#   "logonly"   - Only log suspicious activity without blocking input.

### ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ###
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The following parameters typically do not need modification unless
# you are experiencing specific issues.

# Speed Threshold (in milliseconds):
# The maximum allowed interval between keystrokes. Values faster than this are considered suspicious.
threshold = 30  

# History Array Size:
# The number of recent keystroke intervals to average for determining typing speed.
size = 25  

# Sneaky Mode Key Drop Interval:
# In Sneaky mode, every nth keystroke will be dropped.
# (Default: Drop every 6th keystroke)
randdrop = 6  

# Log Filename:
# The file where attack events and suspicious keystrokes will be recorded.
filename = "log.txt"  

# Auto-Type Software Allowance:
# Set to True to allow keystrokes injected by trusted auto-type software (e.g., KeyPass, LastPass).
allow_auto_type_software = True  


### OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS ###
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Logging Level:
# Set the desired logging level ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL").
